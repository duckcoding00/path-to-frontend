# path-to-frontend
A structured and personal journey into frontend development â€” starting from the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, moving through JavaScript and TypeScript, and culminating in building modern web applications with Svelte.

This repository serves as a hands-on learning log, with progressive modules, small projects, and practical notes to solidify each concept along the way.
